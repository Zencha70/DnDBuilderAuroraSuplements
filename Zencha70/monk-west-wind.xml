			<p><em>3rd-Level Way of the West Wind Feature</em></p>
			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells through the channeling of your ki.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> You prepare the list of spells available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your monk level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level equal or lower than the maximum spell level you can cast.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level monk with a Wisdom score of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ki-Powered Spells.</i></b> To cast one of your spells, you must expend a number of ki points equal to the spell’s level + 1. You may cast a spell at a higher level by expending an additional ki point for each additional level, but you cannot cast a spell at a higher level than your maximum spell level.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and are at least 5th level, you can cast cure wounds at 1st or 2nd level, expending 2 ki points for a 1st-level casting and 3 ki points for a second-level casting. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ki-powered spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ki-powered spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Focus.</i></b> You can use the ki that powers your spells as a spellcasting focus for your ki-powered spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Multiclassing.</i></b> If you have levels in another spellcasting class, you can cast the spells from the other class as ki-powered spells as long as you do not cast the spell above your maximum spell level. You can also cast one of your prepared spells from your monk class using an appropriate spell slot from another class. The monk class does not have spell slots of its own and does not contribute to total spell slots under the multiclassing rules.</p>
